Clone the following repository

```
git clone https://github.com/PhaseZeroTrials/phasezero-python.git
```

It is recommended to use a virtualenv when running the code

Install the requirements by running

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage


### Uploading files from the terminal

Use the `phasezero.cli` module's `upload` command to upload files from your local file system to Phase Zero.


The `upload` command takes the following positional arguments:

```
positional arguments:
  project_id    Project or Folder UUID
  project_path  Path to destination folder in Phase Zero
  paths         Paths to local files or directories
```

Example usage from the terminal

```
python3 -m phasezero.cli -u user@email.com -p yourPhaseZeroPassword upload 1 documents/ ./path/to/files/
```

### Downloading files from the terminal

Use the `phasezero.cli` modules' `download` command to download files from Phase Zero into your local file system
The `download` command takes the following positional arguments:

```
positional arguments:
  project_id    Project Id
  path          Path to desired directory for file to download
  
named arguments:  
  -o            Output local file directory
```
Example usage from the terminal
```
â€‹python3 -m phasezero.cli -u user@email.com -p yourPhaseZeroPassword download 1 cloud_directory/ -o my_local_computer
```

### Deleting files from the terminal

Use the `phasezero.cli` module's `delete` command to delete files from Phase Zero.

The `delete` command takes the following positional arguments:

```
positional arguments:
  project_id    Project Id
  relative_path Relative path of the file to delete
```

Example usage from the terminal:

```
python3 -m phasezero.cli -u user@email.com -p yourPhaseZeroPassword delete 1 /path/to/file.txt
```

This will delete the file located at `/path/to/file.txt` in the project with ID 1.

## Recommendations

If you do not want to run the command in the root of your folder, it is recommended to set add the phaszero module to your  `PYTHONPATH`

[Stack Overflow Example](https://stackoverflow.com/a/53311583)

```aidl
export PYTHONPATH="${PYTHONPATH}:/path/to/my/modules/"
```

This allows the command `python3 -m phasezero.cli` to be run from anywhere

### Setting an Alias

Here is a recommended alias that can be used to easily access the CLI:

```aidl
alias pz_cli="source ~/Documents/pz/python3-venv/pz-python/bin/activate; python3 -m phasezero.cli"
```
